    <p>
      Today was a difficult day, I had really bad stomach pains last night and couldn't get a good night's sleep.
      Work was a bust, my attention span felt like a hummingbird in a sand storm. Despite this, I managed to spend an hour exploring the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to jump in and start playing around with TINK Pascal for the mac system OS 7. 
      Being quite fond of minimal UI and hard black/white colorschemes (see: Pure Data) I have a special fondness for these older macintosh OSes, and i would even say that they are my favourite out of all the old OSes, design wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today I learned some of the basics of the Pascal language on the macintosh and drew this nice drawing.
      Reminds me of the ol' Processing days.

    <p>Onwards and upwards </p>

    <h2 id="day01">Day 1: "the spaces between"</h2>
    <p>
        For day 1, I wanted to start off easy and go to a comfortable space of audiovisual exploration: Pure Data.
      I have long been fascinated by the rhythmic nature of waves phasing and manipulating each others without any grid or rules. A complete free form of natural waves playing with each other creating something that is more beautiful than the sum of its parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this patch I explore this very concept relying on 5 sine waves dancing together and creating their own rhythm. I added a kickdrum to give a better context of the rhythm in case it wasn't evident... and also to headbang. so... enjoy.

    <p>Excited to participate in my first December Adventure.<p>
    <p>
      I have developped a tendency to obsessively seek out new things to learn and disregard the tools I already know well.
      While this is good for advancement and improvement, the downside when not managed properly is a sense of loss, lack of purpose and an eventual burnout.
      At least that has been my experience.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My goal for this year is vague, but with a common underlying theme: focus on using the tools I already know, to create and share things I'm excited about.
      It will, however, revolve around the conception and creation of various forms of static and interactive audio/visual art.
