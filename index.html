    <h2>Day 0: "the day the mind stood still"</h2>
    <p>Excited to participate in my first December Adventure.<p>
    <p>
      I have developped a tendency to obsessively seek out new things to learn and disregard the tools I already know well.
      While this is good for advancement and improvement, the downside when not managed properly is a sense of loss, lack of purpose and an eventual burnout.
      At least that has been my experience.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My goal for this year is vague, but with a common underlying theme: focus on using the tools I already know, to create and share things I'm excited about.
      It will, however, revolve around the conception and creation of various forms of static and interactive audio/visual art.
