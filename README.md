# 256k December Adventure 2024

a microsite dedicated to tracking the progress of 2024's [December Adventure](https://eli.li/december-adventure)

## Ideas:

1- port runes_ to a web browser
	use p5js to create the visuals 
	instead of using hexadecimals create either 16 or 6 runes to represent diff values or params of the sequence
	create each symbol as a sprite 16x16 or something 
	
2- create a website based OS that resembles the minimalism of system OS 6
3- create a very minimal notepad style editor
4- improve the max4live prolly plugin
5- create random pd patches


6- design and build a 1 encoder macropad (the idea i had before)
	scroll between each of the characters and click encoder to input it. 
	possibly add a single button for backspace but ideally not.
	enhancement idea: instead of scrolling through each character of the ascii table, it could be a quantity of macros (strings) to choose from.
	user only sees the number of the slot but remembers which message is each slot.
	create a web interface for it to save and update the slots. (either through usb serial or a websocket? i dont know. ideally just usb serial)


	DESIGN FOR THE BUILD:

	imagine a fidget toy, cylindrically shaped, at the end of it, a metal encoder knob (knurled guitar knob style).
	rests in the balm of your hand with your thumb and index on the encoder knob
	possibly bluetooth? so it;s easily connected to the computer without a wire..

	this is just a one off thing. i just think it could be a cool fidget. even without any use.

	otherwise just a normal small macropad-y flat shape like the SSMP but smaller
